### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Arllette Fonseca
I am person who loves technology and so I  began  playing around with
              websites as a hobby. This journey began with creating WordPress websites for family and friends. Through this hobby, I found
              happiness and a sense of belonging. I decided I wanted to make a career out of this and therefore I  began to further my studies in software development. Today, I enjoy working on meaningful projects on a daily basis.
